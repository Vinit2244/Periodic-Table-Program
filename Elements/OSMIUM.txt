Osmium (from Greek osme, 'smell') is a chemical element with the symbol Os 
and atomic number 76. It is a hard, brittle, bluish-white transition metal 
in the platinum group that is found as a trace element in alloys, mostly in 
platinum ores. Osmium is the densest naturally occurring element. When 
experimentally measured using X-ray crystallography, it has a density of 22.
59 g/cm3. Manufacturers use its alloys with platinum, iridium, and other 
platinum-group metals to make fountain pen nib tipping, electrical contacts, 
and in other applications that require extreme durability and hardness.

Osmium is among the rarest elements in the Earth's crust, making up only 50 
parts per trillion (ppt). It is estimated to be about 0.6 parts per billion 
in the universe and is therefore the rarest precious metal.
Osmium has a blue-gray tint and is the densest stable element; it is 
approximately twice as dense as lead and slightly denser than iridium. 
Calculations of density from the X-ray diffraction data may produce the most 
reliable data for these elements, giving a value of 22.587+-0.009 g/cm3 for 
osmium, slightly denser than the 22.562+-0.009 g/cm3 of iridium; both metals 
are nearly 23 times as dense as water, and 1+1‚ÅÑ6 times as dense as gold.

Osmium is a hard but brittle metal that remains lustrous even at high 
temperatures. It has a very low compressibility. Correspondingly, its bulk 
modulus is extremely high, reported between 395 and 462 GPa, which rivals 
that of diamond (443 GPa). The hardness of osmium is moderately high at 4 GPa.
