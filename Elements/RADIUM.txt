Radium is a chemical element with the symbol Ra and atomic number 88. 
It is the sixth element in group 2 of the periodic table, also known 
as the alkaline earth metals. Pure radium is silvery-white, but it 
readily reacts with nitrogen (rather than oxygen) on exposure to air, 
forming a black surface layer of radium nitride (Ra3N2). All isotopes 
of radium are highly radioactive, with the most stable isotope being
radium-226, which has a half-life of 1600 years and decays into radon 
gas (specifically the isotope radon-222). When radium decays, ionizing 
radiation is a by-product, which can excite fluorescent chemicals and 
cause radioluminescence.

Radium, in the form of radium chloride, was discovered by Marie and 
Pierre Curie in 1898 from ore mined at Jachymov. They extracted the 
radium compound from uraninite and published the discovery at the French 
Academy of Sciences five days later. Radium was isolated in its metallic
state by Marie Curie and Andr√©-Louis Debierne through the electrolysis of 
radium chloride in 1911.

In nature, radium is found in uranium and (to a lesser extent) thorium 
ores in trace amounts as small as a seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite. 
Radium is not necessary for living organisms, and adverse health effects 
are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of 
its radioactivity and chemical reactivity. Currently, other than its use 
in nuclear medicine, radium has no commercial applications; formerly, it 
was used as a radioactive source for radioluminescent devices and also in 
radioactive quackery for its supposed curative powers.
