Copernicium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Cn and 
atomic number 112. Its known isotopes are extremely radioactive, and 
have only been created in a laboratory. The most stable known isotope, 
copernicium-285, has a half-life of approximately 28 seconds. 
Copernicium was first created in 1996 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre 
for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It is named after the 
astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus.

In the periodic table of the elements, copernicium is a d-block 
transactinide element and a group 12 element. During reactions with 
gold, it has been shown to be an extremely volatile substance, so much 
so that it is possibly a gas or a volatile liquid at standard 
temperature and pressure.

Copernicium is calculated to have several properties that differ from 
its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to 
relativistic effects, it may give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s 
ones, and it may have more similarities to the noble gases such as radon 
rather than its group 12 homologues. Calculations indicate that 
copernicium may show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in 
only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not 
show it at all. It has also been predicted to be more difficult to 
oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 
elements. Predictions vary on whether solid copernicium would be a metal, 
semiconductor, or insulator.
The heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine 
two other nuclei of unequal size into one; roughly, the more unequal the 
two nuclei in terms of mass, the greater the possibility that the two react.
