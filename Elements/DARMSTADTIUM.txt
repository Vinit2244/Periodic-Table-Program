Darmstadtium is a chemical element with the symbol Ds and atomic number 
110. It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element. The most stable 
known isotope, darmstadtium-281, has a half-life of approximately 12.7 
seconds. Darmstadtium was first created in 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz 
Centre for Heavy Ion Research in the city of Darmstadt, Germany, 
after which it was named.

In the periodic table, it is a d-block transactinide element. It is a 
member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 10 elements, 
although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out to confirm 
that it behaves as the heavier homologue to platinum in group 10 as 
the eighth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Darmstadtium 
is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, 
nickel, palladium, and platinum.
The heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine 
two other nuclei of unequal size into one; roughly, the more unequal 
the two nuclei in terms of mass, the greater the possibility that the 
two react. The material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target,
 which is then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei. Two nuclei can 
only fuse into one if they approach each other closely enough; normally, 
nuclei (all positively charged) repel each other due to electrostatic 
repulsion. The strong interaction can overcome this repulsion but only 
within a very short distance from a nucleus; beam nuclei are thus 
greatly accelerated in order to make such repulsion insignificant 
compared to the velocity of the beam nucleus.
