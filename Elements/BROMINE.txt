Bromine is a chemical element with the symbol Br and atomic number 35. 
It is the third-lightest halogen, and is a volatile red-brown liquid 
at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly 
coloured vapour. Its properties are intermediate between those of 
chlorine and iodine. Isolated independently by two chemists, Carl 
Jacob Löwig (in 1825) and Antoine Jérôme Balard (in 1826), its name 
was derived from the Ancient Greek ("stench"), referring to its sharp 
and pungent smell.

Elemental bromine is very reactive and thus does not occur free in 
nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, 
analogous to table salt. While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, 
the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br−) has caused its accumulation
 in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from brine 
evaporation ponds, mostly in the United States, Israel, and China. The 
mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth that of 
chlorine.

At standard conditions for temperature and pressure it is a liquid; the 
only other element that is liquid under these conditions is mercury. At 
high temperatures, organobromine compounds readily dissociate to yield 
free bromine atoms, a process that stops free radical chemical chain 
reactions. This effect makes organobromine compounds useful as fire 
retardants, and more than half the bromine produced worldwide each year 
is put to this purpose. The same property causes ultraviolet sunlight 
to dissociate volatile organobromine compounds in the atmosphere to 
yield free bromine atoms, causing ozone depletion. As a result, many 
organobromine compounds—such as the pesticide methyl bromide—are no 
longer used. Bromine compounds are still used in well drilling fluids, 
in photographic film, and as an intermediate in the manufacture of 
organic chemicals.
