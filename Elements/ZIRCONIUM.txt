Zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol Zr and atomic number 40. 
The name zirconium is taken from the name of the mineral zircon (the word 
is related to Persian zargun (zircon; zar-gun, "gold-like" or "as gold"), 
the most important source of zirconium. It is a lustrous, grey-white, 
strong transition metal that closely resembles hafnium and, to a lesser 
extent, titanium. Zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier, 
although small amounts are used as an alloying agent for its strong 
resistance to corrosion. Zirconium forms a variety of inorganic and 
organometallic compounds such as zirconium dioxide and zirconocene 
dichloride, respectively. Five isotopes occur naturally, four of which are 
stable. Zirconium compounds have no known biological role.
Zirconium is a lustrous, greyish-white, soft, ductile, malleable metal that 
is solid at room temperature, though it is hard and brittle at lesser purities. 
In powder form, zirconium is highly flammable, but the solid form is much less 
prone to ignition. Zirconium is highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis,
 acids, salt water and other agents. However, it will dissolve in hydrochloric 
and sulfuric acid, especially when fluorine is present. Alloys with zinc are 
magnetic at less than 35 K.

The melting point of zirconium is 1855 °C (3371 °F), and the boiling point is 
4409 °C (7968 °F). Zirconium has an electronegativity of 1.33 on the Pauling 
scale. Of the elements within the d-block with known electronegativities, 
zirconium has the fifth lowest electronegativity after hafnium, yttrium, 
lanthanum, and actinium.

At room temperature zirconium exhibits a hexagonally close-packed crystal 
structure, α-Zr, which changes to β-Zr, a body-centered cubic crystal 
structure, at 863 °C. Zirconium exists in the beta-phase until the melting 
point.
