Barium is a chemical element with the symbol Ba and atomic number 56. 
It is the fifth element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery alkaline earth 
metal. Because of its high chemical reactivity, barium is never found in 
nature as a free element.

The most common minerals of barium are baryte (barium sulfate, BaSO4) and 
witherite (barium carbonate, BaCO3). The name barium originates from the 
alchemical derivative "baryta", from Greek (barys), meaning "heavy". Baric 
is the adjectival form of barium. Barium was identified as a new element in 
1774, but not reduced to a metal until 1808 with the advent of electrolysis.

Barium has few industrial applications. Historically, it was used as a getter 
for vacuum tubes and in oxide form as the emissive coating on indirectly 
heated cathodes. It is a component of YBCO (high-temperature superconductors) 
and electroceramics, and is added to steel and cast iron to reduce the size of 
carbon grains within the microstructure. Barium compounds are added to fireworks 
to impart a green color. Barium sulfate is used as an insoluble additive to oil 
well drilling fluid, as well as in a purer form, as X-ray radiocontrast agents 
for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract. Water-soluble barium compounds 
are poisonous and have been used as rodenticides.
Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with a slight golden shade when ultrapure. 
The silvery-white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon oxidation in air 
yielding a dark gray layer containing the oxide. Barium has a medium specific 
weight and high electrical conductivity. Because barium is difficult to purify, 
many of its properties have not been accurately determined.

At room temperature and pressure, barium metal adopts a body-centered cubic 
structure, with a barium–barium distance of 503 picometers, expanding with 
heating at a rate of approximately 1.8×10−5/°C. It is a very soft metal with 
a Mohs hardness of 1.25. Its melting temperature of 1,000 K (730 °C; 1,340 °F) 
4–43  is intermediate between those of the lighter strontium (1,050 K or 780 
°C or 1,430 °F) 4–86  and heavier radium (973 K or 700 °C or 1,292 °F); 4–78  
however, its boiling point of 2,170 K (1,900 °C; 3,450 °F) exceeds that of 
strontium (1,655 K or 1,382 °C or 2,519 °F). 4–86  The density (3.62 g/cm3) 
4–43  is again intermediate between those of strontium (2.36 gram/centimeter 
cube) 4–86  and radium (≈5 grams/centimeter cube).
