Protactinium (formerly protoactinium) is a chemical element with the symbol 
Pa and atomic number 91. It is a dense, silvery-gray actinide metal which 
readily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and inorganic acids. It forms 
various chemical compounds in which protactinium is usually present in the 
oxidation state +5, but it can also assume +4 and even +3 or +2 states. 
Concentrations of protactinium in the Earth's crust are typically a few parts 
per trillion, but may reach up to a few parts per million in some uraninite 
ore deposits. Because of its scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, 
there are currently no uses for protactinium outside scientific research, and 
for this purpose, protactinium is mostly extracted from spent nuclear fuel.

The element was first identified in 1913 by Kazimierz Fajans and Oswald Helmuth 
Gohring and named brevium because of the short half-life of the specific isotope 
studied, i.e. protactinium-234. A more stable isotope of protactinium, 231Pa, 
was discovered in 1917/18 by Lise Meitner in collaboration with Otto Hahn, and 
they chose the name protactinium. The IUPAC chose the name "protactinium" in 
1949 and confirmed Hahn and Meitner as discoverers. The new name meant "(nuclear)
 precursor of actinium" and reflected that actinium is a product of radioactive 
decay of protactinium. John Arnold Cranston (working with Frederick Soddy and 
Ada Hitchins) is also credited with discovering the most stable isotope in 1915, 
but delayed his announcement due to being called up for service in the First
 World War.

The longest-lived and most abundant (nearly 100%) naturally occurring isotope of 
protactinium, protactinium-231, has a half-life of 32,760 years and is a decay
 product of uranium-235. Much smaller trace amounts of the short-lived 
protactinium-234 and its nuclear isomer protactinium-234m occur in the decay 
chain of uranium-238.
