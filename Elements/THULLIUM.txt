Thulium is a chemical element with the symbol Tm and atomic number 69. 
It is the thirteenth and third-last element in the lanthanide series. 
Like the other lanthanides, the most common oxidation state is +3, seen 
in its oxide, halides and other compounds; because it occurs so late in 
the series, however, the +2 oxidation state is also stabilized by the 
nearly full 4f shell that results. In aqueous solution, like compounds 
of other late lanthanides, soluble thulium compounds form coordination 
complexes with nine water molecules.

In 1879, the Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve separated from the rare 
earth oxide erbia another two previously unknown components, which he 
called holmia and thulia; these were the oxides of holmium and thulium, 
respectively. A relatively pure sample of thulium metal was first 
obtained in 1911.

Thulium is the second-least abundant of the lanthanides, after 
radioactively unstable promethium which is only found in trace quantities 
on Earth. It is an easily workable metal with a bright silvery-gray 
luster. It is fairly soft and slowly tarnishes in air. Despite its high 
price and rarity, thulium is used as the radiation source in portable X-
ray devices, and in some solid-state lasers. It has no significant 
biological role and is not particularly toxic.
Pure thulium metal has a bright, silvery luster, which tarnishes on 
exposure to air. The metal can be cut with a knife, as it has a Mohs 
hardness of 2 to 3; it is malleable and ductile. Thulium is ferromagnetic 
below 32 K, antiferromagnetic between 32 and 56 K, and paramagnetic above 
56 K.

Thulium has two major allotropes: the tetragonal alpha-Tm and the more 
stable hexagonal beta-Tm.
