Rhenium is a chemical element with the symbol Re and atomic number 75. 
It is a silvery-gray, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of 
the periodic table. With an estimated average concentration of 1 part 
per billion (ppb), rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's 
crust. Rhenium has the third-highest melting point and highest boiling
 point of any stable element at 5869 K. Rhenium resembles manganese and 
technetium chemically and is mainly obtained as a by-product of the 
extraction and refinement of molybdenum and copper ores. Rhenium shows 
in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from âˆ’1 to 
+7.

Discovered in 1925, rhenium was the last stable element to be discovered. 
It was named after the river Rhine in Europe.

Nickel-based superalloys of rhenium are used in combustion chambers, 
turbine blades, and exhaust nozzles of jet engines. These alloys contain 
up to 6% rhenium, making jet engine construction the largest single use 
for the element. The second-most important use is as a catalyst: rhenium 
is an excellent catalyst for hydrogenation and isomerization, and is used 
for example in catalytic reforming of naphtha for use in gasoline 
(rheniforming process). Because of the low availability relative to demand,
 rhenium is expensive, with price reaching an all-time high in 2008/2009 of 
US$10,600 per kilogram (US$4,800 per pound). Due to increases in rhenium 
recycling and a drop in demand for rhenium in catalysts, the price of 
rhenium has dropped to US$2,844 per kilogram (US$1,290 per pound) as of 
July 2018.
