Krypton (from Ancient Greek, romanized: kryptos 'the hidden one') is a chemical 
element with the symbol Kr and atomic number 36. It is a colorless, odorless, 
tasteless noble gas that occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere and is 
often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. With rare exceptions, 
krypton is chemically inert.

Krypton, like the other noble gases, is used in lighting and photography. 
Krypton light has many spectral lines, and krypton plasma is useful in bright, 
high-powered gas lasers (krypton ion and excimer lasers), each of which 
resonates and amplifies a single spectral line. Krypton fluoride also makes a 
useful laser medium. From 1960 to 1983, the official definition of meter was 
based on the wavelength of one spectral line of krypton-86, because of the 
high power and relative ease of operation of krypton discharge tubes.
Krypton was discovered in Britain in 1898 by William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, 
and Morris Travers, an English chemist, in residue left from evaporating nearly 
all components of liquid air. Neon was discovered by a similar procedure by the 
same workers just a few weeks later.William Ramsay was awarded the 1904 Nobel 
Prize in Chemistry for discovery of a series of noble gases, including krypton.

In 1960, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures defined the meter as 
1,650,763.73 wavelengths of light emitted in the vacuum corresponding to the 
transition between the levels 2p10 and 5d5 of krypton-86 isotope . This 
agreement replaced the 1889 international prototype meter, which was a metal 
bar located in Sèvres. This also obsoleted the 1927 definition of the ångström 
based on the red cadmium spectral line, replacing it with 1 Å = 10−10 m. The 
krypton-86 definition lasted until the October 1983 conference, which redefined 
the meter as the distance that light travels in vacuum during 1/299,792,458 s.
