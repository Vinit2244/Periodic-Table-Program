Gadolinium is a chemical element with the symbol Gd and atomic number 64. 
Gadolinium is a silvery-white metal when oxidation is removed. It is only 
slightly malleable and is a ductile rare-earth element. Gadolinium reacts 
with atmospheric oxygen or moisture slowly to form a black coating. 
Gadolinium below its Curie point of 20 °C (68 °F) is ferromagnetic, with 
an attraction to a magnetic field higher than that of nickel. Above this 
temperature it is the most paramagnetic element. It is found in nature 
only in an oxidized form. When separated, it usually has impurities of 
the other rare-earths because of their similar chemical properties.

Gadolinium was discovered in 1880 by Jean Charles de Marignac, who 
detected its oxide by using spectroscopy. It is named after the mineral 
gadolinite, one of the minerals in which gadolinium is found, itself 
named for the Finnish chemist Johan Gadolin. Pure gadolinium was first 
isolated by the chemist Paul-Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran around 1886.

Gadolinium possesses unusual metallurgical properties, to the extent 
that as little as 1% of gadolinium can significantly improve the 
workability and resistance to oxidation at high temperatures of iron, 
chromium, and related metals. Gadolinium as a metal or a salt absorbs 
neutrons and is, therefore, used sometimes for shielding in neutron 
radiography and in nuclear reactors.

Like most of the rare earths, gadolinium forms trivalent ions with 
fluorescent properties, and salts of gadolinium(III) are used as 
phosphors in various applications.
