Fermium is a synthetic element with the symbol Fm and atomic number 100. 
It is an actinide and the heaviest element that can be formed by neutron 
bombardment of lighter elements, and hence the last element that can be 
prepared in macroscopic quantities, although pure fermium metal has not 
yet been prepared. A total of 19 isotopes are known, with 257Fm being the 
longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days.

It was discovered in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 
1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, one of the pioneers of nuclear physics. 
Its chemistry is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of 
the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to 
the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having 
relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside 
basic scientific research.
Fermium was first discovered in the fallout from the 'Ivy Mike' nuclear 
test (1 November 1952), the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. 
Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production 
of a new isotope of plutonium, 244
94Pu
: this could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-
238 nucleus followed by two betaâˆ’ decays. At the time, the absorption of 
neutrons by a heavy nucleus was thought to be a rare process, but the 
identification of 244
94Pu
 raised the possibility that still more neutrons could have been absorbed by 
the uranium nuclei, leading to new elements.Element 99 (einsteinium) was 
quickly discovered on filter papers which had been flown through the cloud 
from the explosion (the same sampling technique that had been used to 
discover 244
94Pu
). It was then identified in December 1952 by Albert Ghiorso and co-workers 
at the University of California at Berkeley.
