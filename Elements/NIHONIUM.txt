Nihonium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Nh and atomic 
number 113. It is extremely radioactive; its most stable known isotope, 
nihonium-286, has a half-life of about 10 seconds. In the periodic 
table, nihonium is a transactinide element in the p-block. It is a 
member of period 7 and group 13 (boron group).

Nihonium was first reported to have been created in 2003 by a Russianâ€“
American collaboration at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) 
in Dubna, Russia, and in 2004 by a team of Japanese scientists at Riken 
in Wako, Japan. The confirmation of their claims in the ensuing years 
involved independent teams of scientists working in the United States, 
Germany, Sweden, and China, as well as the original claimants in Russia 
and Japan. In 2015, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party recognised the 
element and assigned the priority of the discovery and naming rights for 
the element to Riken. The Riken team suggested the name nihonium in 2016, 
which was approved in the same year. The name comes from the common 
Japanese name for Japan (nihon).

Very little is known about nihonium, as it has only been made in very 
small amounts that decay within seconds. The anomalously long lives of 
some superheavy nuclides, including some nihonium isotopes, are 
explained by the "island of stability" theory. Experiments support the 
theory, with the half-lives of the confirmed nihonium isotopes increasing 
from milliseconds to seconds as neutrons are added and the island is 
approached.
