Oganesson is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Og and atomic 
number 118. It was first synthesized in 2002 at the Joint Institute for 
Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, near Moscow, Russia, by a joint team 
of Russian and American scientists. In December 2015, it was recognized 
as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of the internati
onal scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP. It was formally named on 28 
November 2016. The name honors the nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, who 
played a leading role in the discovery of the heaviest elements in the 
periodic table. It is one of only two elements named after a person who 
was alive at the time of naming, the other being Seaborgium, and the only 
element whose eponym is alive today.

Oganesson has the highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all 
known elements. The radioactive oganesson atom is very unstable, and since 
2005, only five (possibly six) atoms of the isotope oganesson-294 have 
been detected. Although this allowed very little experimental character
ization of its properties and possible compounds, theoretical calculations 
have resulted in many predictions, including some surprising ones. For 
example, although oganesson is a member of group 18 (the noble gases) – 
the first synthetic element to be so – it may be significantly reactive, 
unlike all the other elements of that group. It was formerly thought to be 
a gas under normal conditions but is now predicted to be a solid due to 
relativistic effects. On the periodic table of the elements it is a p-block 
element and the last one of period 7.
The heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine 
two other nuclei of unequal size into one; roughly, the more unequal the 
two nuclei in terms of mass, the greater the possibility that the two react.
