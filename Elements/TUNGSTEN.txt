Tungsten, or wolfram, is a chemical element with the symbol W and atomic 
number 74. Tungsten is a rare metal found naturally on Earth almost 
exclusively as compounds with other elements. It was identified as a new 
element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores 
include scheelite and wolframite, the latter lending the element its 
alternate name.

The free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that 
it has the highest melting point of all known elements barring carbon (which 
sublimes at normal pressure), melting at 3,422 °C (6,192 °F; 3,695 K). It 
also has the highest boiling point, at 5,930 °C (10,710 °F; 6,200 K). Its 
density is 19.25 grams per cubic centimetre, comparable with that of uranium 
and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Polycrystalline 
tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material (under standard 
conditions, when uncombined), making it difficult to work. However, pure 
single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile and can be cut with a hard-steel 
hacksaw.

Tungsten occurs in many alloys, which have numerous applications, including 
incandescent light bulb filaments, X-ray tubes, electrodes in gas tungsten arc 
welding, superalloys, and radiation shielding. Tungsten's hardness and high 
density make it suitable for military applications in penetrating projectiles. 
Tungsten compounds are often used as industrial catalysts.

Tungsten is the only metal in the third transition series that is known to 
occur in biomolecules, being found in a few species of bacteria and archaea. 
However, tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism and is 
somewhat toxic to most forms of animal life.
