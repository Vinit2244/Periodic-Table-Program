Yttrium is a chemical element with the symbol Y and atomic number 39. 
It is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the 
lanthanides and has often been classified as a "rare-earth element". 
Yttrium is almost always found in combination with lanthanide elements 
in rare-earth minerals, and is never found in nature as a free element. 
89Y is the only stable isotope, and the only isotope found in the 
Earth's crust.

The most important uses of yttrium are LEDs and phosphors, particularly 
the red phosphors in television set cathode ray tube displays. Yttrium 
is also used in the production of electrodes, electrolytes, electronic 
filters, lasers, superconductors, various medical applications, and 
tracing various materials to enhance their properties.

Yttrium has no known biological role. Exposure to yttrium compounds can 
cause lung disease in humans.

The element is named after ytterbite, a mineral first identified in 1787 
by the chemist Arrhenius. He named the mineral after the village of 
Ytterby, in Sweden, where it had been discovered. When one of the chemicals 
in ytterbite was later found to be the previously unidentified element, 
yttrium, the element was then named after the mineral.
Yttrium is a soft, silver-metallic, lustrous and highly crystalline 
transition metal in group 3. As expected by periodic trends, it is less 
electronegative than its predecessor in the group, scandium, and less 
electronegative than the next member of period 5, zirconium; additionally, 
it is more electronegative than lanthanum, but less electronegative than 
lutetium due to the lanthanide contraction. Yttrium is the first d-block 
element in the fifth period.

The pure element is relatively stable in air in bulk form, due to 
passivation of a protective oxide (Y2O3) film that forms on the 
surface. This film can reach a thickness of 10 µm when yttrium is 
heated to 750 °C in water vapor.
