Radon is a chemical element with the symbol Rn and atomic number 86. 
It is a radioactive, colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas. It 
occurs naturally in minute quantities as an intermediate step in the 
normal radioactive decay chains through which thorium and uranium 
slowly decay into lead and various other short-lived radioactive 
elements. Radon itself is the immediate decay product of radium. Its 
most stable isotope, 222Rn, has a half-life of only 3.8 days, making 
it one of the rarest elements. Since thorium and uranium are two of 
the most common radioactive elements on Earth, while also having three 
isotopes with half-lives on the order of several billion years, radon 
will be present on Earth long into the future despite its short half-
life. The decay of radon produces many other short-lived nuclides, known 
as "radon daughters", ending at stable isotopes of lead.

Unlike all other intermediate elements in the aforementioned decay chains, 
radon is, under standard conditions, gaseous and easily inhaled, and 
therefore a health hazard. It is often the single largest contributor to 
an individual's background radiation dose, but due to local differences 
in geology, the level of exposure to radon gas differs from place to place. 
A common source is uranium-containing minerals in the ground, and therefore 
it accumulates in subterranean areas such as basements. Radon can also 
occur in some ground water like spring waters and hot springs.

Epidemiological studies have shown a clear link between breathing high 
concentrations of radon and incidence of lung cancer. Radon is a contaminant 
that affects indoor air quality worldwide. According to the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), radon is the second most frequent cause 
of lung cancer, after cigarette smoking, causing 21,000 lung cancer deaths per 
year in the United States. About 2,900 of these deaths occur among people who 
have never smoked.
