Rutherfordium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Rf and 
atomic number 104, named after New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford. 
As a synthetic element, it is not found in nature and can only be 
created in a laboratory. It is radioactive; the most stable known 
isotope, 267Rf, has a half-life of approximately 1.3 hours.

In the periodic table of the elements, it is a d-block element and the 
second of the fourth-row transition elements. It is a member of the 7th 
period and belongs to the group 4 elements. Chemistry experiments have 
confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as the heavier homologue to hafnium 
in group 4. The chemical properties of rutherfordium are characterized 
only partly. They compare well with the chemistry of the other group 4 
elements, even though some calculations had indicated that the element 
might show significantly different properties due to relativistic effects.

In the 1960s, small amounts of rutherfordium were produced in the Joint 
Institute for Nuclear Research in the Soviet Union and at the Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory in California. The priority of the discovery 
and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and 
American scientists, and it was not until 1997 that the International 
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established rutherfordium as 
the official name for the element.
The heaviest atomic nuclei are created in nuclear reactions that combine 
two other nuclei of unequal size into one; roughly, the more unequal the 
two nuclei in terms of mass, the greater the possibility that the two react. 
The material made of the heavier nuclei is made into a target, which is 
then bombarded by the beam of lighter nuclei. Two nuclei can only fuse into 
one if they approach each other closely enough; normally, nuclei (all 
positively charged) repel each other due to electrostatic repulsion.
