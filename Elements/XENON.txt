Xenon is a chemical element with the symbol Xe and atomic number 54. 
It is a colorless, dense, odorless noble gas found in Earth's 
atmosphere in trace amounts. Although generally unreactive, it can 
undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexa
fluoroplatinate, the first noble gas compound to be synthesized.

Xenon is used in flash lamps and arc lamps, and as a general anesthetic. 
The first excimer laser design used a xenon dimer molecule (Xe2) as the 
lasing medium, and the earliest laser designs used xenon flash lamps as 
pumps. Xenon is also used to search for hypothetical weakly interacting
 massive particles and as a propellant for ion thrusters in spacecraft.

Naturally occurring xenon consists of seven stable isotopes and two long-
lived radioactive isotopes. More than 40 unstable xenon isotopes undergo 
radioactive decay, and the isotope ratios of xenon are an important tool 
for studying the early history of the Solar System. Radioactive xenon-135 
is produced by beta decay from iodine-135 (a product of nuclear fission),
 and is the most significant (and unwanted) neutron absorber in nuclear 
reactors.
Xenon was discovered in England by the Scottish chemist William Ramsay and 
English chemist Morris Travers in September 1898, shortly after their 
discovery of the elements krypton and neon. They found xenon in the residue 
left over from evaporating components of liquid air. Ramsay suggested the 
name xenon for this gas from the Greek word  xenon, neuter singular form of 
xenos, meaning 'foreign(er)', 'strange(r)', or 'guest'. In 1902, Ramsay 
estimated the proportion of xenon in the Earth's atmosphere to be one part 
in 20 million.
