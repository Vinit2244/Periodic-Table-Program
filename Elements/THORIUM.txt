Thorium is a weakly radioactive metallic chemical element with the 
symbol Th and atomic number 90. Thorium is silvery and tarnishes black 
when it is exposed to air, forming thorium dioxide; it is moderately 
soft and malleable and has a high melting point. Thorium is an 
electropositive actinide whose chemistry is dominated by the +4 oxidation 
state; it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided.

All known thorium isotopes are unstable. The most stable isotope, 232Th, 
has a half-life of 14.05 billion years, or about the age of the universe; 
it decays very slowly via alpha decay, starting a decay chain named the 
thorium series that ends at stable 208Pb. On Earth, thorium and uranium 
are the only significantly radioactive elements that still occur naturally 
in large quantities as primordial elements. Thorium is estimated to be over 
three times as abundant as uranium in the Earth's crust, and is chiefly 
refined from monazite sands as a by-product of extracting rare-earth metals.

Thorium was discovered in 1828 by the Norwegian amateur mineralogist Morten 
Thrane Esmark and identified by the Swedish chemist JÃ¶ns Jacob Berzelius, 
who named it after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Its first applications 
were developed in the late 19th century. Thorium's radioactivity was widely 
acknowledged during the first decades of the 20th century. In the second 
half of the century, thorium was replaced in many uses due to concerns about 
its radioactivity.

Thorium is still being used as an alloying element in TIG welding electrodes
 but is slowly being replaced in the field with different compositions. It 
was also material in high-end optics and scientific instrumentation, used in 
some broadcast vacuum tubes, and as the light source in gas mantles, but 
these uses have become marginal.
