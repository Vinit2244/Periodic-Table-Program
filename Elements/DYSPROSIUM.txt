Dysprosium is the chemical element with the symbol Dy and atomic number 66. 
It is a rare-earth element in the lanthanide series with a metallic silver 
luster. Dysprosium is never found in nature as a free element, though, like 
other lanthanides, it is found in various minerals, such as xenotime. 
Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of seven isotopes, the most 
abundant of which is 164Dy.

Dysprosium was first identified in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, 
but it was not isolated in pure form until the development of ion-exchange 
techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where 
it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high 
thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear 
reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility (χv ≈ 5.44×10−3) in data-
storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive 
material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble 
salts are considered non-toxic.
Dysprosium is a rare-earth element and has a metallic, bright silver luster. 
It is quite soft and can be machined without sparking if overheating is 
avoided. Dysprosium's physical characteristics can be greatly affected by 
even small amounts of impurities.

Dysprosium and holmium have the highest magnetic strengths of the elements, 
especially at low temperatures. Dysprosium has a simple ferromagnetic 
ordering at temperatures below 85 K (−188.2 °C).
