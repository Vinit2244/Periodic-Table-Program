Europium is a chemical element with the symbol Eu and atomic number 63. 
Europium is the most reactive lanthanide by far, having to be stored 
under an inert fluid to protect it from atmospheric oxygen or moisture. 
Europium is also the softest lanthanide, as it can be dented with a 
fingernail and easily cut with a knife. When oxidation is removed a 
shiny-white metal is visible. Europium was isolated in 1901 and is named 
after the continent of Europe. Being a typical member of the lanthanide 
series, europium usually assumes the oxidation state +3, but the oxida
tion state +2 is also common. All europium compounds with oxidation state 
+2 are slightly reducing. Europium has no significant biological role and 
is relatively non-toxic compared to other heavy metals. Most applications 
of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds. Europium is 
one of the rarest of the rare-earth elements on Earth.
Europium is a ductile metal with a hardness similar to that of lead. It 
crystallizes in a body-centered cubic lattice. Some properties of europium 
are strongly influenced by its half-filled electron shell. Europium has 
the second lowest melting point and the lowest density of all lanthanides.

Europium has been claimed to become a superconductor when it is cooled 
below 1.8 K and compressed to above 80 GPa. However the experimental 
evidence on which this claim is based has been challenged. If it becomes 
a superconductor this is believed to occur because europium is divalent 
in the metallic state, and is converted into the trivalent state by the 
applied pressure. In the divalent state, the strong local magnetic moment 
(J = 7/2) suppresses the superconductivity, which is induced by eliminat
ing this local moment (J = 0 in Eu3+).
