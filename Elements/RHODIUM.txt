Rhodium is a chemical element with the symbol Rh and atomic number 45. 
It is a very rare, silvery-white, hard, corrosion-resistant, and 
chemically inert transition metal. It is a noble metal and a member of 
the platinum group. It has only one naturally occurring isotope, 103Rh. 
Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as a free metal, as an 
alloy with similar metals, and rarely as a chemical compound in minerals 
such as bowieite and rhodplumsite. It is one of the rarest and most 
valuable precious metals.

Rhodium is found in platinum or nickel ores together with the other members 
of the platinum group metals. It was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde 
Wollaston in one such ore, and named for the rose color of one of its 
chlorine compounds.

The element's major use (approximately 80% of world rhodium production) is 
as one of the catalysts in the three-way catalytic converters in automobiles. 
Because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive 
chemicals, and because of its rarity, rhodium is usually alloyed with 
platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive 
coatings. White gold is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its
 appearance while sterling silver is often rhodium-plated for tarnish 
resistance. Rhodium is sometimes used to cure silicones; a two-part silicone 
in which one part containing a silicon hydride and the other containing a 
vinyl-terminated silicone are mixed. One of these liquids contains a rhodium 
complex.
