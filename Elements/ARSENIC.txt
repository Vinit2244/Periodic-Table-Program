Arsenic is a chemical element with the symbol As and atomic number 33. 
Arsenic occurs in many minerals, usually in combination with sulfur and 
metals, but also as a pure elemental crystal. Arsenic is a metalloid. It 
has various allotropes, but only the gray form, which has a metallic 
appearance, is important to industry.

The primary use of arsenic is in alloys of lead (for example, in car 
batteries and ammunition). Arsenic is a common n-type dopant in 
semiconductor electronic devices. It is also a component of the III-V 
compound semiconductor gallium arsenide. Arsenic and its compounds, 
especially the trioxide, are used in the production of pesticides, 
treated wood products, herbicides, and insecticides. These applications 
are declining with the increasing recognition of the toxicity of arsenic 
and its compounds.

A few species of bacteria are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory 
metabolites. Trace quantities of arsenic are an essential dietary element 
in rats, hamsters, goats, chickens, and presumably other species. A role 
in human metabolism is not known. However, arsenic poisoning occurs in 
multicellular life if quantities are larger than needed. Arsenic 
contamination of groundwater is a problem that affects millions of people 
across the world.
