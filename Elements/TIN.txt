Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and 
atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery-colored metal that characteristically 
has a faint yellow hue.

Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be 
bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called “tin cry” can 
be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared 
by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state.

Pure tin after solidifying presents a mirror-like appearance similar to 
most metals. In most tin alloys (such as pewter) the metal solidifies 
with a dull gray color.

Tin is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table of 
elements. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which 
contains stannic oxide, SnO2. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both 
of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main 
oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th 
most abundant element on Earth and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the 
largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to 
its magic number of protons.

It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is 
beta-tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal; at low temperatures it is less 
dense grey alpha-tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin 
does not easily oxidize in air and water.

The first tin alloy used on a large scale was bronze, made of 1⁄8 tin and 
7⁄8 copper, from as early as 3000 BC. After 600 BC, pure metallic tin was 
produced. Pewter, which is an alloy of 85–90% tin with the remainder 
commonly consisting of copper, antimony, bismuth, and sometimes lead and 
silver, has been used for flatware since the Bronze Age.
