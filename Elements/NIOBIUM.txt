Niobium, also known as columbium, is a chemical element with the symbol 
Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41. Niobium is a light grey, 
crystalline, and ductile transition metal. Pure niobium has a Mohs hardness 
rating similar to that of pure titanium, and it has similar ductility to 
iron. Niobium oxidizes in the earth's atmosphere very slowly, hence its 
application in jewelry as a hypoallergenic alternative to nickel. Niobium 
is often found in the minerals pyrochlore and columbite, hence the former 
name "columbium". Its name comes from Greek mythology, specifically Niobe, 
who was the daughter of Tantalus, the namesake of tantalum. The name 
reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and 
chemical properties, making them difficult to distinguish.

The English chemist Charles Hatchett reported a new element similar to 
tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium. In 1809, the English chemist 
William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were 
identical. The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum 
ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, a
 series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were 
the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a century both 
names were used interchangeably. Niobium was officially adopted as the name 
of the element in 1949, but the name columbium remains in current use in 
metallurgy in the United States.
