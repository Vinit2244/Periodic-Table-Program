Rubidium is the chemical element with the symbol Rb and atomic number 37. 
Rubidium is a very soft, silvery-white metal in the alkali metal group. 
Rubidium metal shares similarities to potassium metal and caesium metal in 
physical appearance, softness and conductivity. Rubidium cannot be stored 
under atmospheric oxygen, as a highly exothermic reaction will ensue, 
sometimes even resulting in the metal catching fire.

Rubidium is the first alkali metal in the group to have a density higher than 
water, so it sinks, unlike the metals above it in the group. Rubidium has a 
standard atomic weight of 85.4678. On Earth, natural rubidium comprises two 
isotopes: 72% is a stable isotope 85Rb, and 28% is slightly radioactive 87Rb, 
with a half-life of 48.8 billion years—more than three times as long as the 
estimated age of the universe.

German chemists Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered rubidium in 1861 
by the newly developed technique, flame spectroscopy. The name comes from the 
Latin word rubidus, meaning deep red, the color of its emission spectrum. 
Rubidium's compounds have various chemical and electronic applications. Rubidium 
metal is easily vaporized and has a convenient spectral absorption range, making 
it a frequent target for laser manipulation of atoms. Rubidium is not a known 
nutrient for any living organisms. However, rubidium ions have similar properties 
and the same charge as potassium ions, and are actively taken up and treated by 
animal cells in similar ways.
Rubidium is a very soft, ductile, silvery-white metal. It is the second most 
electropositive of the stable alkali metals and melts at a temperature of 39.3 °C 
(102.7 °F). Like other alkali metals, rubidium metal reacts violently with water. 
As with potassium (which is slightly less reactive) and caesium (which is slightly 
more reactive), this reaction is usually vigorous enough to ignite the hydrogen 
gas it produces.
