Neon is a chemical element; it has symbol Ne and atomic number 10. 
It is the second noble gas in the periodic table.

Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard 
conditions, with about two-thirds the density of air. It was 
discovered along with krypton and xenon in 1898 as one of the three 
residual rare inert elements remaining in dry air after nitrogen, 
oxygen, argon and carbon dioxide were removed. Neon was the second 
of these three rare gases to be discovered and was immediately 
recognized as a new element from its bright red emission spectrum. 
The name neon is derived from the Greek word meaning 'new'. Neon 
is chemically inert, and no uncharged neon compounds are known. 
The compounds of neon currently known include ionic molecules, 
molecules held together by van der Waals forces and clathrates.

During cosmic nucleogenesis of the elements, large amounts of 
neon are built up from the alpha-capture fusion process in stars. 
Although neon is a very common element in the universe and solar 
system (it is fifth in cosmic abundance after hydrogen, helium,
 oxygen and carbon), it is rare on Earth. It composes about 18.2 
 ppm of air by volume (this is about the same as the molecular 
 or mole fraction) and a smaller fraction in Earth's crust. The 
 reason for neon's relative scarcity on Earth and the inner 
 (terrestrial) planets is that neon is highly volatile and forms 
 no compounds to fix it to solids. As a result, it escaped from 
 the planetesimals under the warmth of the newly ignited Sun in 
 the early Solar System. Even the outer atmosphere of Jupiter is 
 somewhat depleted of neon, although for a different reason.
