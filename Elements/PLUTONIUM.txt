Plutonium is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol Pu and atomic 
number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes 
when exposed to air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element 
normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with 
carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon, and hydrogen. When exposed to moist air, 
it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, 
which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and 
can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.

Plutonium was first synthetically produced and isolated in late 1940 and early 
1941, by a deuteron bombardment of uranium-238 in the 1.5-metre (60 in) 
cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. First, neptunium-238 (half-
life 2.1 days) was synthesized, which subsequently beta-decayed to form the new 
element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 (half-life 88 years). Since
 uranium had been named after the planet Uranus and neptunium after the planet 
Neptune, element 94 was named after Pluto, which at the time was considered to 
be a planet as well. Wartime secrecy prevented the University of California 
team from publishing its discovery until 1948.

Plutonium is the element with the highest atomic number to occur in nature. 
Trace quantities arise in natural uranium-238 deposits when uranium-238 captures 
neutrons emitted by decay of other uranium-238 atoms.

Both plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile, meaning that they can sustain 
a nuclear chain reaction, leading to applications in nuclear weapons and nuclear 
reactors. Plutonium-240 exhibits a high rate of spontaneous fission, raising the 
neutron flux of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a
 plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel.
