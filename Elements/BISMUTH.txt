Bismuth is a chemical element with the symbol Bi and atomic number 83. 
It is a post-transition metal and one of the pnictogens with chemical 
properties resembling its lighter group 15 siblings arsenic and antimony. 
Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, and its sulfide and oxide forms are 
important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is 
a brittle metal with a silvery-white color when freshly produced, but 
surface oxidation can give it an iridescent tinge in numerous colours. 
Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element and has one of the lowest 
values of thermal conductivity among metals.

Bismuth was long considered the element with the highest atomic mass that is 
stable, but in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive: 
its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a 
half-life more than a billion times the estimated age of the universe. 
Because of its tremendously long half-life, bismuth may still be considered 
stable for almost all purposes.

Bismuth metal has been known since ancient times, although it was often 
confused with lead and tin, which share some physical properties. The 
etymology is uncertain, but the word may come from the German words 
Masse or Wismuth ("white mass"), translated in the mid-sixteenth century 
to New Latin bisemutum or bisemutium.
Bismuth compounds account for about half the production of bismuth. They 
are used in cosmetics; pigments; and a few pharmaceuticals, notably bismuth 
subsalicylate, used to treat diarrhea. Bismuth's unusual propensity to 
expand as it solidifies is responsible for some of its uses, such as in 
the casting of printing type. Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a 
heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent 
years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently about a 
third of bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.
